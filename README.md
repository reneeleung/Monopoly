## Aim of the Game
To be the only player left in the game after everyone has gone bankrupt.

## Rules
### Playing
1. On your turn, roll the dice to move around the board. According to the space you
land on, you can buy the property (if it isn’t owned by another player), pay rent (if it is owned by another player), pay fees, draw a Chance or Community Chest Card, or go to jail.
2. Once you won a color group, build houses or hotels on those sites.
3. If you run out of money, sell property to pay off your creditors. if you cannot raise
enough money to pay rent, tax or a bill, you are declared bankrupt and are out of the game.
4. No player may borrow money from, or lend money to, another player. However, a player may choose to trade your property.
5. Continue until only one player is left in the game. This player is the winner.

### Recieving Money
Receiving money from passing go, rent, chance and community chest cards, Sale of houses and hotels.

### Paying Money
Paying money for rent, property, fees, chance and community chest cars, houses and hotels. Owning a property entitles you to collect rent from any players on that space. Once you own all of the site in one colour group, i.e. You own a St.A-Poly, you can build houses and hotels on sites in that group and collect more rent!

### Paying Rent
If your roll ends your turn on a site that is owned by another player, you must pay rent. The rent will be automatically deducted from your bank account and transferred to the owner before the next player rolls the dice. The amount payable is shown on the title deed card and varies according to the number if buildings on the site.
If you own a whole colour group, the rent is doubled on any undeveloped site of that group (i.e., a site without houses or hotels)

### Utilities:
If you land on an owned utility, pay rent to the owner according to the number you rolled
to get there. If the owner has one utility the rent will be four ties your dice roll. if the owner has both utilities, the rent will be ten times the amount of your dice roll.

### Public Facilities
If you land on an owned facility, pay the amount printed on the Title Deed card to the owner. The amount payable if shown on the Title Deed card and depends on the number of other facilities owned by that player (Rent is 25 marks per facility owned).

### Detention
You will be sent to Detention if you land on the “Go to Detention” space, or pick a
Chance or Community Chest card, which tells you to “Go Directly to Detention”. Your turn ends when you are sent to Detention. You will be moved on to the Detention space and there will not be makes collected regardless of where you were on the board. While in Detention, you can collect rent on properties.
You will be sent out of Detention after three turns.

### Buying Property
There are three types of property:
1. Sites
2. Public Facilities
3. Utilities

If you land on an unowned property, you have the first choice to buy it. If you decide to buy pay the banked the price printed on that space. You will receive that property’s Title Deed card as proof of ownership.
